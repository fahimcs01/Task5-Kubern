Installed Tools

Docker, kubectl, Minikube.

Started Kubernetes Cluster

Ran minikube start → local cluster with 1 node ready.

Deployed an App

Created deployment.yaml → deployed Nginx app with 2 pods.

Verified pods using kubectl get pods.

Exposed the App

Created service.yaml → NodePort service to access app from browser.

Verified service using kubectl get svc.

Scaled Deployment

Used kubectl scale deployment my-nginx --replicas=4 → increased pods to 4.

Checked Pods & Logs

Used kubectl describe pod <pod-name> and kubectl logs <pod-name>.

Screenshots

Took screenshots of pods, service, and pod details for submission.

Key Concepts Learned:

Minikube → run Kubernetes locally.

NodePort service → expose app outside cluster.

kubectl scale → scale app pods up or down.
